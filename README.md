# timelog: Command line time tracking made simple

## Requirements


## Summary

```
$ timelog start thesis
$ timelog stop "Finished introduction"
$ timelog status
```

## Data storage

## TODOs (in no specific order):
  - Some nice exports
  - It would be nice to connect it to git-flow
  - External commands (just to try)

## Acknowledgement
This project is inspired by command line wrapper for [basecamp][basecamp-link] you can find [here][basecamper-link]. Also this is my first project in Haskell.
