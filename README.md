# timelog: Command line time tracking made simple

## Requirements


## Summary

```
$ timelog start thesis
$ timelog stop "Finished introduction"
$ timelog report
```

## Data storage

## TODOs (in no specific order):
  - Some nice exports
  - It would be nice to conect it to git-flow
  - External commands (just to try)
